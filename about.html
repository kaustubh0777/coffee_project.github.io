              Homie Coffee Shop offers a unique coffee house environment
             unlike any other in Macon. We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup
              of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you can
               sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. 
               If you need to work, we have a seating  
               area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating area
                in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body.  
                We offer a delicious variety of coffee roasted in house made by our professionally
                 trained baristas. We have everything from classic coffee to our house made 
                  specialty beverages.  All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house with all
                   natural  
                  ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives) ensuring you the highest quality in taste & health. 
                   You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker. 
                    We look forward to serving you at Homie Coffee Shop!
